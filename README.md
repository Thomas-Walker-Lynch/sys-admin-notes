# sys-admin-notes

Various notes and sketches for guides that I have made while doing sys-amdin tasks. As they were for my personal use they are in various states of refinement.  Hopefully there is enough present to be useful. 

These are .odt or .docx files done with libre office.  At stome point I will have to unify the style template.  Right now the only thing they have in common is that code is in a monospaced font.

When I revisit a task I try to update the notes. If you want to contribute your insights the improvemetns to the notes will very much be appreciated.

Perhaps due to this evolution the notes might be integrated into guides or texts published elsewhere. I added an MIT license here so that those will carry acknowledgements to contributors where appropriate.

In the off chance there is an unresolved disagreement over the notes on the main branch I reserve the right to decide the outcome.
